# Random Notes

## Macro definitions

```C
#ifdef __vita__
```

Checking for preprocessor macro variables on your tool chain
arm-vita-eabi-gcc -dM -E - < /dev/null | grep -i VITA

that's how i found __vita__

## versioning based on git tags

Read the cmake tutorial which goes through setting up
variables like version through an internal environment variables
I then found a stackoverflow for the exact thing, see CMakeLists.txt:32:38

## link macos specific libs from /Frameworks.../ to /usr/local/include for intellisense.

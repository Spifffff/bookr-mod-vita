Porting experience

# Random Notes

## Macro definitions

```C
#ifdef __vita__
```

Checking for preprocessor macro variables on your tool chain
arm-vita-eabi-gcc -dM -E - < /dev/null | grep -i VITA

that's how i found __vita__

## versioning based on git tags

Read the cmake tutorial which goes through setting up
variables like version through an internal environment variables
I then found a stackoverflow for the exact thing, see CMakeLists.txt:32:38

## Using Visual Studio Code

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37522462/visual-studio-code-includepath
link macos specific libs from /Frameworks.../ to /usr/local/include for intellisense.
```sh
ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Headers/ /usr/local/include/OpenGL
```

## Going from GLUT to GLFW

On macOS 10.9+ i get deprecation warnings for the system's GLUT, so swapping to GLFW (newest and more supported)
```sh
... 17 other warnings
src/graphics/fzscreenglut.cpp:183:2: warning: 'glutMainLoop' is deprecated: first deprecated in macOS 10.9
      [-Wdeprecated-declarations]
        glutMainLoop();
        ^
/usr/local/include/GLUT/glut.h:438:22: note: 'glutMainLoop' has been explicitly marked deprecated here
extern void APIENTRY glutMainLoop(void) OPENGL_DEPRECATED(10_0, 10_9);
```
